# 🚀 Project Overview: TgaysEducation Training Portal

## **1. Executive Summary**
This project is a high-end, **automated Learning Management System (LMS)** specifically designed to manage **live cohort-based training programs**. Unlike generic video course platforms (like Udemy), this system is built for **live interaction**, streamlining the chaos of managing Zoom links, student attendance, payments, and resource sharing into one sleek, professional dashboard.

---

## **2. The Problem It Solves**
Running live workshops manually is a logistical nightmare:
*   **"Where is the link?"**: Admins waste hours sending Zoom links and reminders manually on WhatsApp/Email.
*   **"Did I pay?"**: Tracking monthly fees and expiry dates in Excel is prone to errors.
*   **"I missed the class"**: Students lose track of schedules and notes scattered across different chats.
*   **Revenue Leakage**: Students sharing links with unpaid friends.

## **3. The Solution: Key Features**

### **🔐 Smart Access Control (The "Coupon" System)**
*   **Code-Based Entry**: Access is strictly controlled. Admins generate unique "One-Time Use" codes (Coupons) corresponding to specific batches (e.g., "Python Jan Batch").
*   **Subscription Management**: The system automatically calculates access duration. If a student pays for 1 month, the system auto-locks their account exactly when that month ends.
*   **Revenue Protection**: Since access is tied to a user account and validated continuously, users cannot just share a "Zoom Link" with friends—they need a valid, logged-in account to join.

### **📅 The Interactive "Command Center" Calendar**
*   **Live Schedule**: Students see a beautiful, dynamic monthly calendar showing all their classes.
*   **Smart "Join" Button**:
    *   **Before Class**: Shows a countdown.
    *   **During Class**: The "Join" button lights up. Clicking it automatically redirects them to the Zoom/Meet link AND **marks their attendance** in the database instantly.
    *   **After Class**: Turns into a status indicator (e.g., "✅ Attended" or "❌ Missed").

### **🤖 Automated Logistics (Zero-Touch Admin)**
*   **Auto-Reminders**: The system works for you while you sleep. It automatically sends professional emails **6 hours before** and **30 minutes before** every single class.
*   **Welcome Automation**: The moment a student enrolls, they get a branded "Welcome Aboard" email with all their details.

### **📂 Centralized Resource Hub**
*   No more emailing zip files. Admins attach notes/assignments directly to a specific class date. Students simply click the class in their calendar to download materials.

## **4. Business Benefits for the Client**
1.  **Professional Image**: Moves the business away from "WhatsApp groups" to a branded, tech-enabled platform.
2.  **Scalability**: One admin can now manage 10 batches and 1000 students because the reminders and link sharing are automated.
3.  **Data Insights**: You know exactly who attended which class and who is skipping, allowing for better student support.
4.  **Operational Peace of Mind**: Use the "Set it and Forget it" model. Schedule the batch once, and the system handles the rest for the entire month.

**In short:** This platform transforms a manual coaching business into a scalable, automated EdTech company.
